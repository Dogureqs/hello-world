# hello-world
This is my first GitHub repository.

My name is Theron Hern, and I am a Senior at the College of Idaho.
I'm a Mathematics-Computer Science major with minors and music and visual studies.
I'm interested in product development work and video game design. In my spare time,
I try to write critiques and analyses of video games, though I'm focusing now on staying
productive in my every-day life.
